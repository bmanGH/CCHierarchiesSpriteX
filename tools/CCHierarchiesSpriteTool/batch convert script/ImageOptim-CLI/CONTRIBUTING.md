## Creating issues

Please include the version number of ImageOptim-CLI you're using (`imageOptim --version`) and if applicable to your issue the version numbers of ImageOptim, ImageAlpha and JPEGmini.

## Contributing code

You'll need to run `npm install` after checking out the project.

All editing is done in /src with
/bin/* and /README.md being generated from those files through running `grunt build`.

Alternatively, running `grunt watch` once will run `grunt build` for you whenever you save a file in
/src.
